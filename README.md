# Front End Lab Community

## What is this community for?

This is a space where women can come together and help each other learn and understand web development. We welcome devs of all levels and encourage those with more experience to help out those that are just starting. There's always at least one mentor/leader present to help you with best practices or to guide you through if you are stuck with a nasty problem! Study group will have the following format:

* 6:00pm  - Setup
* 6:10 - 6:20pm - Quick Introductions
* 6:20 - 6:40pm - Lightning Talk  (a quick presentation or talk) (if planned)
* 6:40 - 7:30pm - CODE!
* 7:30 - 8:00pm - Group chat and wrap up

All events are scheduled via our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Dayton-Code-Together/) page.

## What if I'm a first timer that's never coded before?

Check out our Guide to [front end for first timers](https://github.com/dytcodetogether/front-end-lab/blob/master/first-timers-guides/first_timers_guide.md), that also contains information on how to learn about coding. Go through the recommended resources and ask lots of questions!

## What if I'm a web development pro?

We super encourage you to attend the study group, work on a personal project or take one of the recommended courses to further your skills, help others with questions they might have, consider doing a lighting talk, consider being a lead!

### How can I contribute without being a lead?

We need lots of help coordinating events. If you want to help out please let us know :)
