#HTML

**HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)** elements are the building blocks of the Web.  HTML defines the basic structure of a page and your styles(CSS) and interactivity(Javascript) are based off of your HTML. Every web page, at it’s core, starts with HTML!

HTML consists of elements in opening and closing tags (in angle brackets, i.e. ```<h1>This is a Headline!</h1>```).  The opening tag - ```<h1>``` - starts the element and the closing tag - ```</h1>``` tells the web browser the element has ended. 

Attributes provide more information about your HTML element. They consist of a name and value pair. For example:

```<p lang=“en-us”>This paragraph is in English</p>```

This ```<p>``` element has a language attribute ```(lang)``` with the value of English ```(en-us)```.  This attribute indicates to the browser the ```<p>``` element’s content will be in English. 

Well-written HTML is clean, lean, and semantic. The HTML element should match the role of the content. For example:

```<header>``` tag for a page’s header
```<nav>``` tag for a navigation bar
```<p>``` tag for paragraphs or blocks of text

Let’s use some of the resources below to get you writing your first web page with HTML!

As an opening exercise...
Go to your favorite website and type in:

Cmd + Option + I (on Mac) OR 
Ctrl + Shift + I (on Windows)

This open’s your browser’s Developer Tools. Here you can inspect the page’s HTML!  Have a look around, see how they organized the code, and see if you can recognize some basic HTML elements. 

If this is your first time with HTML/CSS, we encourage you to go through our [First Timer's Guide]().
