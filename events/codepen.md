# CodePen

## Role of CodePen

At Front End Lab, we use CodePen to sign in attendees and share relevant links and events at each session. This allows us to quickly share links and other resources with attendees who have not joined Slack yet.

## How to Create a Pen

1. Visit http://codepen.io/
2. Login in with the DCT account (ask leads in Slack for info)
3. Give the Pen a name with the date, e.g. "Front End Lab - Monday, March 7th, 2019"
4. Copy and paste the CodePen Text (below) into the blank Pen
5. Write the CodePen URL on the whiteboard to share with attendees
6. Encourage attendees to sign up (not required)

## Share CodePen with Attendees

Write the CodePen URL on a whiteboard in large, easy to read handwriting at the meeting.
